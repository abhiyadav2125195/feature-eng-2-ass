    "While the Filter method for feature selection has its advantages, it also comes with certain drawbacks and limitations. Here are some common drawbacks of using the Filter method:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lack of Interaction Consideration: The Filter method evaluates features individually without considering their interactions or dependencies. Some features might be individually uninformative but provide valuable information when combined with other features. Therefore, the Filter method can miss out on such interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignoring Model Performance: The Filter method doesn't take into account how features impact the actual model's performance. A feature might have a high correlation with the target variable but might not contribute much to the model's accuracy. Conversely, a feature with lower correlation could be important when combined with other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitivity to Irrelevant Features: The Filter method might select irrelevant features if they happen to have high scores according to the chosen metric. This can lead to overfitting and decreased model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias towards Certain Types of Features: The choice of scoring metric in the Filter method can bias the selection of certain types of features. For example, if variance is used as a metric, continuous features with high variance might be favored over categorical features."
